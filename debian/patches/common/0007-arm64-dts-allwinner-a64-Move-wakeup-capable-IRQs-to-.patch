Subject: [PATCH 013/194] arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Move wakeup-capable IRQs
 to r_intc

All IRQs that can be used to wake up the system must be routed through
r_intc, so they are visible to firmware while the system is suspended.

For the A64, r_intc IRQ numbers are offset by 32 from the GIC IRQ
numbers.
